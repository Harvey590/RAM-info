# RAM info
Shows useful info about RAM in short view

Just copy the code in `cli_script` and paste it into your termainal - and execute then

Works on dedicated servers with ubuntu, else setups not tested, but most likely they will also work

Example:

<img width="412" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1293318-081f-4720-947c-0618a514dd07" />

If Type (DDR4 / DDR5 etc) is not specified, but you want to know it - then you need to google it by RAM model. But nominal speed of RAM is enough to understand it
